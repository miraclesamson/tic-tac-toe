Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!

This is a simple React implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid and the objective is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

To run the game, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run npm install to install the required dependencies. Then run npm start to start the game.

The game will display the game board and prompt the first player to make a move. Players will alternate turns until the game is won or tied.

The game will check for valid moves and prevent players from making illegal moves. Once the game is over, the program will display the winner (if there is one) or announce that the game is a tie.

Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!
